PhD student at Ã‰cole Polytechnique, working on simulating virtual crowds through Deep Reinforcement Learning. Check out my [recent paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04735)! In the past I was at University of Warsaw, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, and Aalto University.

In my free time, I'm a maintainer of [Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym), sometimes reviewing other people's bugs, sometimes adding my own bugs... I mean, features. Sometimes I also help with [PettingZoo](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/PettingZoo), [SuperSuit](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/SuperSuit) and other projects in the [Farama Foundation](https://farama.org/).

My two main personal projects are [Coltra](https://github.com/RedTachyon/coltra-rl) and [CrowdAI](https://github.com/RedTachyon/CrowdAI), which both form the core of my PhD research. Coltra is a somewhat general DRL library, designed to work seamlessly with multiagent environments and complex observation spaces. CrowdAI is a crowd simulation engine built on top of Unity ML-Agents in which I animate my crowds.

If you're interested in collaborating/hiring me/something of that sort, that might be a bit tricky at the moment. I'm open to contributions to Coltra, but I'm not ready to make it community-driven just yet. I'm generally not available for internships (unless you're DeepMind or something) before I graduate, which should happend around October 2023. Might be up for some freelancing, consulting and the like. And open-source contributions -- depending on my bandwidth. But if we already talked (e.g. on the [RL Discord](https://discord.gg/FJZnzTENRp)), chances are, I'll be up to help you with whatever you ned.
